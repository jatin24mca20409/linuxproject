This project demonstrates the use of fundamental Linux commands to create and manage a simple project with Git version control, alongside GitHub integration for remote collaboration. 
It involves setting up a structured directory, writing a basic Python "Hello, World!" script, and initializing a Git repository to track changes. 
The project also addresses modern GitHub authentication challenges by implementing secure access using both a Personal Access Token (PAT) and SSH key authentication. 
Through these steps, the project highlights the importance of organized file structures, version control, and secure coding practices in collaborative software development.
